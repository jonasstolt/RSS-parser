# RSS-parser
RSS-parser for shell, or Conky, written in shell script, Python, Ruby and Perl

I wrote these scripts primarily because Conky's RSS parser seemed unable to handle URIs with "&" characters. First, I wrote a shell script, but I wasn't satisfied, can't even remember why. So, I re-wrote the shell script in Python, then in Ruby, and finally in Perl. Just because I wanted to. And it was fun, especially since I had never used Ruby before. These are all simple scripts that most people can write or modify according to their own preferences.
